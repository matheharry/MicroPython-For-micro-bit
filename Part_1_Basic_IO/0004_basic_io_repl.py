# We introduce the concept of a variable to which
# we reserve a little box in our computer's memory
# to hold the string which we are going to type
# when prompted to provide our favorite food and
# favorite drink
favorite_food = input('What is your favorite food? ')
favorite_drink = input('What is your favorite drink? ')

# Here we use MicroPython's built-in format method 
# which is part of the string module's Formatter 
# class as the following line of code will provide 
# a response back based to the console based on
# our two variables which we inputted above
print('I love {0} and {1} as well!'.format(favorite_food, favorite_drink))
