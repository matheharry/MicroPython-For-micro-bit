Escape Room Application Requirements
------------------------------------
1. Define the purpose of the application.
   a. Create a game where we build an escape room style adventure game with 
      our micro:bit with questions as we are placed inside a mountain cave
      and work our way through different places in the cave where we randomly
      stumble upon a question space and one of the questions spaces when 
      answered correctly gives us a red key which we will need for the other
      randomly placed question.  Once you answer the question which gives you
      the red key you can then answer the question that will let you out of the 
      cave or room to the outside world.  The micro:bit display will show an 
      outline of the cave and the player moving around a map.
2. Define the rules of the application.
   a. If the player answers a correct question and that question has the red key
      then a red key will be placed into a persistent inventory.
   b. If the player answers the final room question and they have the red key in 
      their inventory then they escape to the outside and win.
3. Define the logical steps of the application.
   a. Edit our data.py and populate our database.
   b. Build out our Grid class logic.
   c. Build out our Player.py base class logic.
   d. Build out our EscapeRoomPlayer.py child class logic.
   e. Build out our FileManager.py class logic.
   f. Build out our Game.py class logic.
   g. Build out our main.py logic to properly account for the integration of all    
      of the above classes and guarantee proper functionality.
